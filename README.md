# ðŸ•’ Tick-Talk  

> **Disclaimer:** This project was developed during my **first hackathon** with **no prior experience** as a full-stack developer. As a result, the final product is far from the original vision outlined in the document **"What is Tick-Talk"**.  
> After the hackathon, I **paused development**, so the web app remains in its **MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage**.

### ðŸ“Œ About the Project  
Tick-Talk is a **language exchange platform** that introduces **time as a currency**, allowing users to **earn time by teaching their native language and spend it to practice a target language**. The original concept envisioned AI-powered translations, smart matchmaking, and gamification to enhance the learning experience. However, the current version is just a **basic prototype**.

### ðŸš€ Current Status & Future Plans  
Since the hackathon, development has been on hold, and the platform remains in its early MVP stage. While there are no immediate plans to continue development, I hope to revisit the project in the future.
